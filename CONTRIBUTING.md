# How to contribute

We definitely welcome your patches and contributions!

If you are new to github, please start by reading [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).


## Maintaining clean commit history

If there is an issue associated with the work that you are doing, please prefix your commit with the issue number.
For example:

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
	CONTRIBUTING.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

This ensures that the commit will be linked to the github issue.


## Guidelines for pull requests

* Each pull request should focus on addressing a single concern.
* For speculative changes, open an issue to facilitate discussion.
* Pull requests should be linked to their source ticket if one exists.
* Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.
* Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master.
* Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing so.
