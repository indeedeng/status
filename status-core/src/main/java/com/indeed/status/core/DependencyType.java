 * An interface for the enum class that describes which type the {@link Dependency} is.

 * investigation. {@link DependencyType} provides a standard way to describe the type of the
 * dependency.
 *
 * <p>By implementing this interface, the categorization and terminology of the dependencies is
 * intended to be shared within the system. As a result, the documentation of the dependencies will
 * exist in the health check code.
 *
 * <p>An example implementation is {@link StandardDependencyTypes}. If your project needs its own
 * implementation of {@link DependencyType}, please create another.
