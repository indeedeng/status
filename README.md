Status is a project to help report the current state of external systems that an application depends on, as well as
the current health of any internal aspects of the application.

## Dependency Management

Constructing dependencies for various services is easy.
Simply extend the `PingableDependency` and implement the ping method.
If the ping method throws an exception, then the status of the dependency will be failing.

```java
import com.indeed.status.core.PingableDependency;
import com.indeed.status.core.Urgency;

public class SimpleDependency extends PingableDependency {
    private SimpleDependency() {
        super("simple", "my description", DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, DEFAULT_PING_PERIOD, Urgency.REQUIRED);
    }

    @Override
    public void ping() throws Exception {
        // code to check dependency (return void for GOOD! and throw and exception for BAD)
    }
}
```

A `PingableDependency` returns one of two `CheckStatus`: `OK` and `OUTAGE`.
For better control over a check, see `AbstractDependency`, `SimpleDependency`, or `ComparableDependency`.
Based on the `CheckStatus` returned and the `Urgency` of the corresponding dependency, a systems health reflects as follows:

| Status \ Urgency | REQUIRED | STRONG | WEAK   | NONE |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| OUTAGE           | OUTAGE   | MAJOR  | MINOR  | OK   |
| MAJOR            | MAJOR    | MAJOR  | MINOR  | OK   |
| MINOR            | MINOR    | MINOR  | MINOR  | OK   |
| OK               | OK       | OK     | OK     | OK   |

When evaluating a whole systems status, it computes the minimum health value of all dependencies.
In other terms:

```
A Systems Status = min(dependency check status)
```

### Servlet Reporting

By default, the status-web package provides an `AbstractDaemonCheckReportServlet` that can be extended to pass the dependency manager appropriately.

```java
import com.indeed.status.web.AbstractDaemonCheckReportServlet;

public class StatusServlet extends AbstractDaemonCheckReportServlet {
    private final AbstractDependencyManager manager;

    public StatusServlet(AbstractDependencyManager manager) {
        this.manager = manager;
    }

    @Override
    protected AbstractDependencyManager newManager(ServletConfig config) {
        return manager;
    }
}
```

Once extended, the servlet can be mounted on any path and accessed in the browser.

```java
final ServletContextHandler handler = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.NO_SESSIONS);        
handler.setContextPath("/");

final DependencyManager manager = new DependencyManager();
manager.addDependency(new SimpleDependency());

final StatusServlet servlet = new StatusServlet(manager);
handler.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new StatusServlet()), "/private/status");

final Server server = new Server(port);
server.setHandler(handler);
server.start();
```

### Evaluating Status

The servlet approach is great for developers working with web applications, however, some tools do not provide a web interface.
For these tools, you can interact with the dependency manager directly to evaluate the status of all dependencies.

```java
final CheckResultSet status = dependencyManager.evaluate();
```

By calling the getSystemStatus method, you can get the overall status of the system.
This is useful for bottle-necking services that may be in a broken or degraded state.

```java
status.getSystemStatus();
```

Another option available to developers is the ability to check the status of a single dependency.
This will allow applications to gracefully degrade by circumventing problematic code paths.

```java
status.get("simple").getStatus();
```

## Healthchecks

Healthchecks are pages within applications that take all the dependencies and dump their statuses in a JSON format
They can help shed light into services that are currently unavailable or unhealthy.
This feature is only available through the status-web package.

### Failing Healthchecks

Failing healthchecks make it easy to determine good starting points when it comes to debugging problems in development, staging, and production environments.
When a healthcheck is failing, it can fail for a variety of reasons with a different status (see the section on Dependency Management).
Below is a sample of what a failing healthcheck might look like through the reporting system.

```json
{
    "hostname": "pitz.local",
    "duration": 19,
    "condition": "OUTAGE",
    "dcStatus": "FAILOVER",
    "appname": "crm.api",

            "urgency": "Required: Failure of this dependency would result in complete system outage",
            "documentationUrl": "http://www.mysql.com/",
            "type" : "mysql",
            "servicePool" : "dbpool.example.com:3306/mysqldb1",
            "thrown": {
                "exception": "RuntimeException",

                    "com.indeed.status.core.PingableDependency.call(PingableDependency.java:15)",

                    "java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)"
                ]
            },
            "date": "2015-02-24T22:48:37.782-0600"
        }],
        "OK": [{

        }]
    }
}
```

### Passing Healthchecks

When all the dependencies are passing, they will report a healthy status of OK.
The JSON dump below is a sample of what a passing healthcheck looks like.

```json
{
    "hostname": "pitz.local",
    "duration": 186,
    "condition": "OK",
    "dcStatus": "OK",
    "appname": "crm.api",
    "catalinaBase": "/var/folders/7t/vsd_gsrn6y99fpl2ydmlszyw0000gn/T/tomcat.5084685826050345209.8000",
    "leastRecentlyExecutedDate": "2015-02-24T22:56:16.568-0600",
    "leastRecentlyExecutedTimestamp": 1424840176568,
    "results": {
        "OK": [{
            "status": "OK",
            "description": "mongo",
            "errorMessage": "ok",
            "timestamp": 1424840176568,
            "duration": 1,
            "lastKnownGoodTimestamp": 0,
            "period": 0,
            "id": "mongo",
            "urgency": "Required: Failure of this dependency would result in complete system outage",
            "documentationUrl": "http://www.mongodb.org/",
            "type" : "mongo",
            "servicePool" : "dbpool.example.com:27017/mongodb1",
            "date": "2015-02-24T22:56:16.568-0600"
        }, {
            "status": "OK",
            "description": "mysql",
            "errorMessage": "ok",
            "timestamp": 1424840176569,
            "duration": 185,
            "lastKnownGoodTimestamp": 0,
            "period": 0,
            "id": "mysql",
            "urgency": "Required: Failure of this dependency would result in complete system outage",
            "documentationUrl": "http://www.mysql.com/",
            "type" : "mysql",
            "servicePool" : "dbpool.example.com:3306/mysqldb1",
            "date": "2015-02-24T22:56:16.569-0600"
        }]
    }
}
```

## Components

### [status-core](https://github.com/indeedeng/status/tree/master/status-core)

Provides the core components for reporting the status of various application dependencies.
Can be used without the status-web package and does not requires a web server.

### [status-web](https://github.com/indeedeng/status/tree/master/status-web)

Provides components that can be used with web applications to provide a clean JSON dump of the current application status.
Requires the status-core package and does require a web server that supports servlets.
